  ## Description
  #### This application allows users to manage their budget by tracking expenses and deposits. With or without internet connection, users are able to log their expenses and deposits. Transactions that occur offline will be updated when there is internet connection. This is achieved by using IndexedDB to add offline functionality, as well as a service worker and web manifest to make this a Progressive Web Application.
